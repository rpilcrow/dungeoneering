/*
Dungeoneering - Chemistry Tweaks

- Rare syringes? So that drinking reagents is the standard
- Altered reagent list; alchemical reagents?
- Reagents harvested from mobs?
- Increase rate at which reagents are metabolized
- Maybe remove metabolism penalty for drinking reagents

alchemical reagents;
Ash - Carbon

Vitriol - Sulphuric Acid
Acidium Salis - Hydrochloric Acid
Aqua Vitae - Ethanol
Aqua Regia - Nitric Acid + Hydrochloric Acid (Polynitric replacement?)
Aqua Fortis - Nitric Acid
Alkahest - A 'universal solvent', perhaps loot?
Azoth/Panacea - A 'universal medicine'. Adminheal?

Lead - Saturn
Tin - Jupiter
Copper - Venus
Iron - Mars
Mercury - Mercury
Silver - Moon
Gold - Sun

Salt - Body
Mercury - Soul
Sulfur - Spirit
